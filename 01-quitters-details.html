												" HELLO, Hey! young man! Stop consuming tobacco ! Look at the damage
												it's done to my tongue!"<br>

												Exclaims Mr. Sachin Manohar Handage , when he observes today's youth
												chewing tobacco.
												He has an approach of “Maybe! I can stop the younger generation, who,
												like me, started a tobacco addiction in their early twenties. “ So , as
												we say ! “Everything happens for a reason !” One affected , can inspire
												the youth !<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
												In 2015 , Mr Sachin Manohar Handage got a mouth ulcer and a venous clot
												near his throat. He neglected it since he assumed it was normal, but it
												did not heal for another two months. When he visited the doctor , the
												doctor said there is a chance of Mouth Cancer . Ofcourse! It shook him
												off ! In his mind, a slew of questions arose... Is it possible to cure
												this cancer? Is everything going to be okay? How much will it cost at
												least? He was terrified. At such moments, everyone needs someone to
												offer them strength and reassure them that everything will be fine. His
												little brother, being a pharmacist, did an extensive research on cancer
												treatments and cures, as well as a hunt for cancer treatment health
												centers where he might find good doctors to treat Mr. Sachin .<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
												Mr Sachin gave up tobacco as soon as he was cognizant that it was
												causing him cancer! After 6 months of radiations and chemotherapies , he
												eventually gained faith in himself and realized that he had overcome
												cancer! . At this point of time, he was reborn. He had maintained his
												composure during the entire process and spent roughly 6-7 lakhs for the
												cancer treatment . He gave up all of his bad habits and addictions,
												including smoking, drinking, and even eating non-vegetarian food .<br><br>
												&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, his mouth cancer recurred in 2018 i.e after 3 years of
												the treatment , owing to anxiety , mental stress and daily slog .This
												time he was under a lot of pressure . It was shocking that despite
												taking so many measures and receiving treatment at Tata Hospital, he was
												still diagnosed with cancer . He was already frustrated when this
												happened and then he met someone in the hospital who gave him some
												ayurvedic recommendations, which made his life much easier. Keeping a
												positive outlook on the situation which is getting repeated
												unfortunately, he subsequently began using ayurvedic and homeopathic
												therapies, which he found effective for his body .

											</p>
											
											<p>
												<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
												Mr. Sachin, a courageous man, claims that ayurveda had such a profound
												influence on him that he didn't even require chemotherapy or radiation
												treatments the second time around. The total cost was around 2 to 2.5
												lakhs in the 2nd treatment . Unfortunately, he went through a tongue
												incision during this operation .
												<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He believes that exercising consistently, eating greens, and avoiding
												habits such as smoking, consuming alcoholic beverages are all ways to
												live a healthy lifestyle. Mr. Handage is indeed a true inspiration to
												all cancer survivors who are fighting this life-threatening disease. Mr.
												Sachin is a very sporty person who is always willing to help others in
												his community who are dealing with cancer. Mr. Sachin's advice to
												today's youth is to steer away from any negative addictions, which
												generally begin in their early twenties.He also gave a big advice to
												choose our friend circle wisely , as –“ As much as people refuse to
												believe it , but the company you keep does have an impact and influence
												on your choices . “
